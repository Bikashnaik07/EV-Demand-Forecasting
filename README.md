# EV-Demand-Forecasting
Exploratory Data Analysis of EV adoption trends in Washington State using historical vehicle registration data (2017â€“2024).

# EV Adoption Trends - Week 1

This project aims to analyze and visualize electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in Washington State using publicly available data from the Department of Licensing (2017â€“2024). The analysis focuses on the rise of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and overall EV penetration over time.

## Week 1 Milestone Includes:
- Dataset exploration and cleaning
- Monthly EV registration trends
- State-wise aggregation of BEVs and PHEVs
- EV penetration rate calculation
- Time-series visualizations

This marks the first milestone of an ongoing project to forecast future EV and charging demands using machine learning and time-series models.
